	<h1>About Comic Scouts</h1>
		<h2>Our History</h2>
		<p>Comic Scouts was started as a means of supporting local comic book shops and finding the comics that you need. Most comic shops don't have the resources to have all of their inventory up on the web. With thousands of comics its a daunting task, so breaking that up into small sprints where visitors can upload a handful of comics at a time can accomplish the same thing.</p>

<p>We hope that we are able to uncover some of the great deals that can be found locally and even help guide collectors to the shops that have the age or titles they are looking for.</p>

		<h2>Here's a quick run through of how things work around here:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Find & Add Comics</h3>
				<p>While you're visiting your local comic shop, at the bottom right corner you can tap on the blue button to add a comic you see. Fill out the title and issue number, if you see a price add it as well. Images are optional, try to get the whole cover with as little glare if possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Search for Comics</h3>
				<p>Visit the homepage and search in the top bar or look through the buckets of comic categories we have. You can also visit individual stores that have been scouted to see what they have.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Add a comic to your wishlist</h3>
				<p>Have a comic you are looking for? Create a wishlist item and it'll show up if its been scouted. Check back often to see if someones found one.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Stay Connected</h3>
				<p>Follow us on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/comicscouts/">Instagram</a></p>
